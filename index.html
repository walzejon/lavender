      Lavandula <em>(common name lavender)</em> is a genus of 39 known species
      of flowering plants in the mint family, <em>Lamiaceae</em
      ><span class="footnote">[1]</span>. It is native to the Old World and is
      found from Cape Verde and the Canary Islands, Europe across to northern
      and eastern Africa, the Mediterranean, southwest Asia to southeast India.
      Many members of the genus are cultivated extensively in temperate climates
      as ornamental plants for garden and landscape use, for use as culinary
      herbs, and also commercially for the extraction of essential oils. The
      most widely cultivated species, Lavandula angustifolia, is often referred
      to as lavender, and there is a colour named for the shade of the flowers
      of this species.

    <p class="intro">
      This article is about the genus of flowering plants known as lavender. For
      the most widely cultivated species in that genus, see

    <h2>description</h2>
    <p id="disc">
      The genus includes annual or short-lived herbaceous perennial plants, and
      shrub-like perennials, subshrubs or small shrubs.<span class="footnote"
        >[2]</span
      >
      Leaf shape is diverse across the genus. They are simple in some commonly
      cultivated species; in others they are pinnately toothed, or pinnate,
      sometimes multiple pinnate and dissected. In most species the leaves are
      covered in fine hairs or indumentum, which normally contain the essential
      oils. Flowers are borne in whorls, held on spikes rising above the
      foliage, the spikes being branched in some species. Some species produce
      coloured bracts at the apices. The flowers may be blue, violet or lilac in
      the wild species, occasionally blackish purple or yellowish. The calyx is
      tubular. The corolla is also tubular, usually with five lobes (the upper
      lip often cleft, and the lower lip has two clefts).

    <h2>shades of lavender</h2>
    <p class="shades">
      Lavender is a pale tint of purple. It applies particularly to the color of
      the flower of the same name. The <em>web color</em> called lavender is
      displayed at the far left swatch. It matches the color of the very palest
      part of the lavender flower. However, the more saturated color shown in
      the next cell to the right is <em>floral lavender</em>. This more closely
      matches the average color of the lavender flower and is the tone of
      lavender historically and traditionally considered lavender by the average
      person as opposed to those who are web site designers.<span
